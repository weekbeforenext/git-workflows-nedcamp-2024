## Create a Feature Branch
1. When starting a issue, use these commands to create an issue feature branch:

    ```
    git checkout develop
    git pull
    git checkout -b feature/<github-username>/<issue-number>--<short-description-of-issue>
    ```
2. Complete your issue task.
3. When your changes are ready, use the following to review your file changes:

    ```
    git status
    ```

3. Use the following commands to stage your changes:

    New files:
    ```
    git add <path/to/file>
    ```

    Existing files:
    ```
    git add -p
    ```
    [Interactive mode with patch subcommands](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add#Documentation/git-add.txt--p) will allow you to review each change and intentionally stage it with  [patch subcommands](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add#Documentation/git-add.txt--p).
4. Once everything is staged, run the following command to commit your changes to your feature branch:

    ```
    git commit -m "<issue-number>: <short-description-of-changes>."
    ```
    Including the issue number in your commit comes in really handy when a developer needs to track down why particular changes were made. This is also why issue comments and documentation are important.
5. Now that changes are committed, you can push them to GitHub using this command:

    ```
    git push -u origin <feature-branch>
    ```

## Create a Pull Request
Pull requests are how you merge your feature branches into the `develop` working branch. It also allows your work to be reviewed by a mentor or team member before it merges.
- [Creating a pull request (GitHub)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

Just be sure to set your "base" to `develop` and "compare" to your feature branch.

## Request a Review
1. Update your issue:
    1. Remove yourself from "Assignees".
    2. Assign to your partner or a teammate.
    3. Set "Status" to "Review".
2. Assign the Pull Request to the partner or teammate.

## Review a Pull Request
1. Verify the target branch is `develop`.
2. Verify there are no merge conflicts.
3. Click on the "Files changed" tab to review the changes.
    1. Verify the changes do not violate the event's [Code of Conduct](https://nedcamp.org/code-conduct).
    2. Verify the Acceptance Criteria of the issue has been met.
    3. Verify there are minimal grammatical or syntax errors.
        * It is probably helpful to click on the feature branch, navigate to the changed file, and verify it renders as expected.

    1. Leave a positive comment.
    2. Select "Approve".
    3. Click on the "Submit review" button.

## Resolve Merge Conflicts

    ```
2. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository.

    ```
    git pull
    ```
3. Checkout your feature branch.

    ```
    git checkout <feature-branch>
    ```
4. Merge `develop` into your feature branch.

    ```
    git merge develop
    ```
5. Use your code editor's conflict resolution tool to resolve the conflicts.
    * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_merge-conflicts)
    * [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/resolving-conflicts.html#distributed-version-control-systems)
6. Verify all of the changes are staged.

    ```
    git status
    ```
7. Commit the merged changes.

    ```
    git commit --no-edit
    ```
8. Push your feature branch to the remote repository.

    ```
