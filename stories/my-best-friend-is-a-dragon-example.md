# My best friend is a dragon
People say that dragons aren’t real, but I know better...

The other day, while I was on a run through the woods, I heard the loudest screech coming from behind me. When I turned around, I couldn't believe what I saw!

It was a small youngish aged turtle, slightly mutated, eating pizza. Not the typcial pizza you normally see turtles eat, but pizza with pinapple on it. Oh the humanity!
