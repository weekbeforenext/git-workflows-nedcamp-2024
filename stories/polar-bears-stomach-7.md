#  A Polar Bear's Stomach
Issue Number: 7

I had no idea how big a polar bear’s stomach really was until I was inside of one.

It started out like any other trip to the Arctic—a research expedition, part of a team studying polar bear migration patterns. We’d been out on the ice for days, tracking and observing, making meticulous notes about behavior, ice thickness, and the effects of climate change on the animals. But something strange happened that day. The blizzard came out of nowhere, fierce and fast, swallowing the horizon and throwing us off course.

We were separated from the rest of the team. By the time the snow cleared, I found myself alone, miles from base, with nothing but the howl of the wind to keep me company. That’s when I saw it.

A polar bear—massive, its fur white like the snow, the kind of creature you only see in nature documentaries, if you're lucky. The thing was enormous, at least 12 feet from nose to tail, with muscles rippling under its thick coat. My first instinct was to run, but I knew better. I froze, doing my best to keep calm.

But the bear didn't seem to notice me at first. It was more interested in the seal carcass nearby, gnawing away on the remains. I tried to back away slowly, but then I slipped, the snow giving way beneath me. The bear turned, eyes narrowing, nostrils flaring. I swear I could feel the ground vibrate under its weight as it padded closer.

Before I knew it, I was on my back, staring up at the wide, dark sky—and then, in one swift motion, the bear's massive paw swiped at me, knocking me off my feet and into a hidden crevice in the ice. The world spun. The next thing I knew, the cold was overwhelming, and the ground was shifting beneath me.

I was inside its mouth. The teeth—long, sharp, and curved—clamped around me, and I felt the world close in, the darkness swallowing me whole. I could hear the rumble of its stomach as the bear moved, then the wet sloshing of its throat as it swallowed. There was a suffocating moment where everything was still. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was inside a predator, a creature I had spent my whole career studying.

Inside the belly of the beast, I found a strange kind of peace. The walls of its stomach were surprisingly soft, not like the sharp, dry texture I imagined. I tried to push myself free, but the bear’s digestive acids began to wash over me, and panic set in. I knew I didn’t have much time. I focused on the wall of the stomach, listening for any sign of movement outside.

It felt like hours, though I couldn’t tell. Time was weird inside the belly of a giant polar bear. But then, a sudden lurch, and I was catapulted upward. The bear gave a great cough, its chest heaving as it expelled me—like an afterthought, as if I were nothing more than an inconvenient scrap of food it couldn’t digest. I landed hard on the snow, gasping for air, covered in the remnants of the stomach’s juices.

I crawled away as quickly as I could, shaking with fear and disbelief. The bear watched me for a moment before lumbering off, uninterested in finishing what it had started. It was like I wasn’t even a meal to it—just an obstacle.

I managed to find my team a few hours later, delirious and covered in bear slime. They thought I had gone mad at first. But when I showed them the burn marks on my clothes and told them about the inside of a polar bear's stomach, they didn’t doubt me for a second.

I’ll never forget that moment, though. The sheer size of that stomach—the vastness of it. The polar bear wasn’t just an apex predator of the ice. It was a whole world unto itself, a place where things were consumed and then forgotten. I didn’t just learn about the power of the bear that day; I learned about the humbling, terrifying scale of nature—and how, sometimes, you can be swallowed whole by a world you never even knew existed.
